# classify-messages-as-Spam-or-Ham

Ideas
The project's goal is to classify messages as Spam or Ham. I also compared different machine learning techniques and deep learning approaches, as mentioned in the project. The spambase dataset from UCI is used in this project.
1. Traditional Machine Learning Algorithm
In this approach, I used traditional machine learning to perform the classification task. In addition, I calculated a correlation matrix with respect to data and labels to extract features from the data, resulting in improved model accuracy.
With accuracy scores of 0.59 and 0.67, we can see that the SVC and MultinomialNB algorithms perform poorly when compared to other algorithms. The main reason for this is that it is sensitive to outliers and performs poorly when dealing with large amounts of data.
  
2. Deep Learning Approach
In this approach, I used deep learning machine algorithm to perform the classification task. Accuracy score is 0.89
